    # There are multitudes of examples for each category:
    #   1. Focusing on switching the order of words when giving responses.
    #   2. Using diverse choices of vocabulary and possible synonyms when entering 
    #      the training data to optimize different possibilities of responses.
    #   3. Ensuring that each category has at least 30 different possible ways 
    #      of responding to a query. (At the time of writing this comment, I hope 
    #      this number will increase drastically as I aim to gather as much 
    #      training data as possible to train my model.)
    #   4. Focusing on training data that uses category-specific keywords, 
    #      which makes it easier for the model to distinguish between categories 
    #      and correctly identify what the user needs.
    #   5. Adding categories that consist of "off-topic" responses, so the model 
    #      can learn to distinguish between real and fake requests.
